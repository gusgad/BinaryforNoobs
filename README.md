# BinaryforNoobs

'Binary for Noobs' is a game for beginner programmers helping to understand how the binary system in fact works. It is especially useful for developers who have no CS backgound because it helps to learn and interact at the same time.

This is my personal project based on vanilla JavaScript(ES6). Any kind of shoutout or share would be appreciated! :)
